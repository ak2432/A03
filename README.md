Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

• 𝐁𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐡: A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.

• 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐞: A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.

• 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).

• 𝐅𝐞𝐭𝐜𝐡: When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.

• 𝐆𝐈𝐓: Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. 

• 𝐆𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐮𝐛: Github is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time.

• 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞: Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

• 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐭: A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

• 𝐏𝐮𝐬𝐡: To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.

• 𝐏𝐮𝐥𝐥: Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.

• 𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐞: This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com.

• 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲: A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
